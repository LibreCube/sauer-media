Definitions:
	map content / map package:	map itself; map config; textures, sounds [...] in the map package itself, 
								NOT: textures (...) that are using on the map, but not included in THIS map package
	
	
To do:
	1.	Discuss which licenses are fine. Don't forget to be sure that the licenses are free.
		Free means it allows you the following to do with the content:
			- Use
			- Share
			- Remix
			- Building upon the work
			- Edit
			- (Ofc) sharing the changed work freely again
		 ... in any way you like
	
	
	2.1		Make a list of all existing officals sauerbraten maps
	2.2		Check out if the maps are uploading offical on quadropolis, if YES:
		2.2.1	Add the info to the list of maps which license the map have (after the attribute on quadro)
		2.2.2	If the map content (map itself; textures, sounds [...] in the map package itself, 
				NOT: textures (...) that are using on the map, but not included in this map package) is licensed under completly free terms:
				
				2.2.2.1		Change the directory tree of the map package
				2.2.2.2		Update the map.cfg to the new directory tree
				2.2.2.3		Add this map to the repo
		
	2.3		AFTER adding the right now totally free map packages:
		2.3.1	Searching in the directory for a creator, add all existing infos about the creator to the list of maps
		

.... Todo in progress ....
